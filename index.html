                Why Borderlands 2 is the best!

        <h2>Reason One</h2>
        <p>The reason Borderlands 2 is the best Borderlands is because borderlands 1 didn't have much voice acting for when you receive quest, so you had to read a LOT. Borderlands 3 had too much going on for the player to focus on bosses, so some bosses were almost impossible due to too many enemies to focus on and projectiles. </p>

        <h2>Reason 2</h2>
        <p>Borderlands 2 main villian was almost always interacting with the player so you and the villian developed a "relationship". In borderlands 1 it was mostly focused on story which isn't too bad but it could had have more bosses, or had told us the main villian sooner. Borderlands 3's boss has no story and there are still bugs too. </p>

        <h2>Reason 3</h2>
        <p>The final reason why is beacuase Borderlands 2 has my favorite character which is Axton a commando who has the ability to summon a sebre turret that shoot enemies and can eventualy develop good skills and abilities </p>
